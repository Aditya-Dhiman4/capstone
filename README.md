For CLC 12


database.py:

Allows me to upload price data (open, high, low, close) and volume from any stock.

Before running the program, scroll to the bottom to the 2 execute commands. When inputting a new ticker symbol, you must create the table first so you must comment out the execute command that has insert_into in it. After the table is created, then comment out the execute command with create_table in it and uncomment insert_into, then run the code.

When the program is running, the user will be prompted to enter a ticker symbol for any stock. The input is not case sensitive. Invalid inputs will return an error.
